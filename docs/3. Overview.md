# 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the **Digital Product Passport Dashboard** project, including supply-chain concepts, database models, access control policies, admin interfaces, and development setup.

# 2. Supply Chain Stakeholders

1. **Supplier**  
   Supplies raw materials to Manufacturers.

2. **Manufacturer**  
   Creates products that are purchased by Retailers.

3. **Distributor**  
   Offers transportation services between Suppliers, Manufacturers, Retailers, and Consumers. Distributors never own the product; they are tracked as a service.

4. **Retailer**  
   Purchases products from Manufacturers and receives shipments from Distributors.

5. **Consumer**  
   Purchases products from Retailers, receiving them either directly from Retailers or via Distributors.

> *Note: “Stakeholder” is modeled as a `Company` in the database.*

# 3. Product Orders

A stakeholder can place or receive a **ProductOrder**, which records:

- **Products** and their **quantities** (via `ProductOrderItem` line‑items).  
- A **delivery location**.  
- The **supplying company** (`supplier`).  
- The **receiving company** (`receiver`).  
- The **timestamp** (`order_time`).  
- The set of **Supply Chain Requirements** (`requirements`) specified by the receiver.

# 4. Product Supply Chain Requirements

Companies define distribution requirements that products must satisfy. Each **SupplyChainRequirement** includes:

| Requirement          | Unit        | Attribute Type |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Temperature Control  | Degrees C   | Number         |
| Humidity Control     | Relative %  | Number         |
| Gas Control          | TVOC        | Number         |
| Light Control        | Lux         | Number         |
| Pressure Control     | hPa         | Number         |
| Acceleration Control | m/s²        | Number         |
| Location Control     | Location    | Location       |

- For **Number** requirements, `details` JSON holds `min`, `nominal`, and `max` values.  
- For **Location** requirements, `details` JSON holds `whitelist` and `blacklist` arrays of region codes or names.

# 5. Database Models

## 5.1 Accounts App

- **Company**  
  Represents a stakeholder; fields: `name`, `type` (supplier, manufacturer, …).

- **User**  
  Extends Django’s `AbstractUser`, optional FK to `Company`, plus any extra profile fields.

## 5.2 Supplychain App

- **Role** & **UserRole**  
  Role definitions (e.g. admin, viewer) and assignment to users.

- **Product**  
  Tracked item with unique `product_key`, optional `batch`, and current `owner`.

- **ProductEvent**  
  Lifecycle events (manufactured, temperature_reading, etc.) with `data_hash` and optional `data_uri`.

- **CustodyTransfer**  
  Tracks change of custody: `from_company`, `to_company`, `timestamp`.

- **SupplyChainRequirement**  
  Defined in Section 4.

- **ProductOrder**, **ProductOrderItem**, **ProductOrderRequirement**  
  Order header, line‑items, and explicit through‑model linking orders to requirements for future extensibility.

## 5.3 ABAC App

- **SubjectAttribute**, **ResourceAttribute**  
  Key/value attributes on users and resources.

- **Policy**, **PolicySubjectAttribute**, **PolicyResourceAttribute**, **PolicyAction**  
  ABAC policy engine tables for dynamic permission evaluation.

# 6. Access Control (ABAC)

## 6.1 Subject Attributes

| Name               | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `company_type`     | stakeholder role (supplier, manufacturer, etc.) |
| `company_id`       | ID of the user’s company                  |
| `scanned_products` | (Consumers) list of `product_key` scanned |
| `is_superuser`     | Django superuser flag                     |

## 6.2 Resource Attributes

Attributes added to instances:

- **ProductOrder**: `supplier_company_id`, `receiver_company_id`  
- **ProductEvent**: `product_owner_id`, `product_order_id`  
- **CustodyTransfer**: `from_company_id`, `to_company_id`  
- **ProductOrderRequirement**: `order_id`, `requirement_id`  
- **Product**: `product_key`

## 6.3 Actions

- `create_order`, `view_order`  
- `create_event`, `view_event`  
- `create_custody_transfer`, `view_custody_transfer`  
- `view_requirement`

## 6.4 Policies

Policies combine subject attrs, resource attrs, and actions to allow or deny. See **ABAC_PERMISSIONS.md** for detailed definitions.
