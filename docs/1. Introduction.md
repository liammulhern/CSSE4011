# 1. Introduction

I now want to create a rest api for the product model. Products can be created by companies that are manufacturers 

I want to extend/add the models associated with the product lifecycle. 

# Supply Chain Stakeholders

1. Supplier: Supplies raw material to Manufacturers
2. Manufacturer: Creates products that are purchased by Retailers 
3. Distributor: Offers transportation from Supplier to Manufacturer, Manufacturer to Retailer, and Retailer to Consumer. (Distributors never own the product, they are a middleman service that is tracked during the supply chain)
4. Retailer: Purchases products from Manufacturers and receives them from Distributors
5. Consumer: Purchases products from Retailers and can recieve them from Distributors or directly from the Retailer

*Stakeholder is modelled as a company in the database so it used interchangably

# Product Orders

A stakeholder can receive a product order for a product/s from another stakeholder. A product order notes the
- Product/s with an associated quantity
- A delivery location
- The company supplying the product/s
- The company receiving the product/s
- The time the product order takes place
- The Product Supply Chain Requirements as dictated by the company receiving the product/s

# Product Supply Chain Requirements

Companies are able to specify the distribution requirements that a product must have. Requirements are able to have 1 or more attribute types that specify the data the expect to be entered. Examples of these fields can be fields

| Requirement          | Unit       | Attribute Types                       |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Temperature Control  | degrees C  | Numbers                               |
| Humidity Control     | relative % | Numbers                               |
| Gas Control          | TVOC       | Numbers                               |
| Light Control        | Lux        | Numbers                               |
| Pressure Control     | hPa        | Numbers                               |
| Acceleration Control | m/s/s      | Numbers                               |
| Location Control     | location   | Continents, Countries, States, Cities |

Requirements can also have attributes associated with them depending on the requirement's attribute type:

## Numbers
1. Minimum Value: Describes the lowest allowed unit of measurement of the requirement
2. Nominal Value: Describes the expected unit of measurement of the requirement
3. Maximum Value: Describes the maximum allowed unit of measurement of the requirement


## Location (i.e. Continent, Countries, States, Cities, etc)
1. Whitelisted Location: describes a location that a product can travel inside of
2. Blacklisted Location: describes a location that a product can not travel inside of
