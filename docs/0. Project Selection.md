**Product Lifecycle Blockchain Passport**

**Project and Scenario Description**  
An end-to-end IoT + blockchain solution that creates a tamper-proof “Digital Product Passport” (DPP) for physical goods. From material supplier to consumer, each manufactured product carries a unique QR code that encodes a link to the user dashboard with JWT for authentication and hash to it's block chain model. 

Embedded sensor nodes (e.g. thingy52) record environmental data (temperature, humidity, location, custody transfers, impact) throughout the supply chain. This data is transmitted over bluetooth advertising to a gateway node (e.g. NRF52840_DK) located in critical locations along the supply-chain, hashing and anchoring snapshots on the IOTA blockchain. 

Clients placing a product order specify the requirements that the products must be subject to while in distribution. They are then alerted if the product exceeds these specifications. Sensor nodes also offer an NFC interface that can be scanned and link to the user dashboard identifying alterts and product status. Stakeholders—from suppliers to consumers—scan the QR code to instantly verify provenance, integrity, and handling history, improving trust, compliance, and recall responsiveness.

- Mote: Lightweight firmware reads tag, senses environment, hashes data, transmits.
- Edge & Cloud: Gateway aggregates, Azure IoT Hub ingests, Azure Functions store raw logs in Azure CosmosDB and push hashes on-chain. Data is also stored off-chain for fatster look ups and is verified using on-chain hash.
- Application: Stakeholders login or use JWT-protected QR codes to sign into dashboard which fetches combined on-chain/off-chain data for visualization, showing alerts. Clients submit product orders through dashboard and identify the requirements that the product must be shipped in.
