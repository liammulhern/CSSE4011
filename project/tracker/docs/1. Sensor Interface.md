# Implementation Outline for Tracker Data Collection & Low-Power Management

## 1. Overview

* Goal: Sample sensors periodically and on-critical-event, buffer readings, then sleep to conserve power.
* Key components:

  * **Sensor drivers:** I2C/SPI/ADC interfaces.
  * **Interrupt controller:** GPIO/EXTI for wake-up on impact.
  * **Power management:** System suspend/resume, clock gating.
  * **Scheduler:** Timer for periodic wake.
  * **Data buffer:** In-memory or flash-backed circular queue.

## 2. Prerequisites & Dependencies

* Zephyr RTOS with Power Management enabled (`CONFIG_PM`, `CONFIG_SYS_POWER_MANAGEMENT`).
* Sensor driver modules (e.g., accelerometer, temperature).
* GPIO/EXTI configuration for interrupts.
* Real-Time Clock / SysTick timer.

## 3. Hardware Interrupt Setup

* Configure a GPIO pin with interrupt-on-edge for impact sensor.
* Define callback to wake from sleep and timestamp event.
* Debounce or filter to avoid false triggers.

## 4. Periodic Sampling with Timer

* Use Zephyr `k_timer` or `RTC` for low-power periodic wake-ups.
* On timer expiration, gather batch of sensor readings.
* Restart timer before re-entering sleep.

## 5. Data Buffering Strategy

* Circular buffer in RAM for recent readings (struct with timestamp + data).
* On buffer-full or critical threshold, mark batch ready for upload.
* Optionally persist to flash if power-loss risk.

## 6. Power Management States

* **Active:** During sampling/upload.
* **Idle:** CPU idle but peripherals on.
* **Suspend/Sleep:** Enter lowest-power state (`PM_STATE_SOFT_OFF`) between events.
* Hook Zephyr `pm_control` callbacks for pre/post sleep tasks.

## 7. Interrupt Handling Flow

1. Enter sleep with interrupts enabled.
2. On event interrupt, wake CPU.
3. In ISR, record minimal info (timestamp, event flag).
4. Schedule deferred work to read sensor data and store to buffer.
5. Clear interrupt and return to scheduler.

## 8. Main Application Loop

```c
while (true) {
  if (batch_ready) {
    trigger_ble_upload();
  }
  enter_low_power();
}
```

## 9. Integration with BLE Bulk-Upload

* After sampling/upload, reuse BLE scan/connect/write logic.
* Only wake for BLE when batch-ready flag set.
* Return to low-power immediately after upload.

## 10. Testing & Validation

* Simulate periodic timer events and ISR triggers.
* Measure wake/sleep durations and current draw.
* Validate no data loss on rapid back-to-back interrupts.

## 11. Power Profiling & Optimization

* Use on-board power profiler or current meter.
* Tune sleep duration vs. sampling rate.
* Disable unused peripherals before sleep.

## 12. Future Enhancements

* Dynamic sampling frequency based on activity.
* Adaptive power states (light-sleep vs. deep-sleep).
* Sensor fusion and threshold-based wake logic.
