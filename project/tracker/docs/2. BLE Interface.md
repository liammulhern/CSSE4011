# Implementation Outline for BLE Bulk-Upload System

## 1. Overview

* Goal: Allow tracker devices to opportunistically upload batched sensor data to any available gateway over BLE.
* Roles:

  * **Gateway (Peripheral)**: Advertises a standard GATT service and accepts incoming batch uploads.
  * **Tracker (Central)**: Scans for gateways, connects, and writes its pending batch data.

## 2. Prerequisites & Dependencies

* Zephyr RTOS SDK with Bluetooth support
* C Makefiles or West project configuration
* Unique 128-bit UUIDs for service and characteristic

## 3. BLE Service Definition

* Define Service UUID for batch uploads
* Define Characteristic UUID for writing bulk data (WRITE / WRITE\_NO\_RESP)

## 4. Gateway Node Implementation

> Refer to `gateway/docs/"1. BLE Interface"` for further details

### 4.1 Configuration (prj.conf)

* Enable `CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL` and `CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICES`
* Set device name and advertising parameters

### 4.2 GATT Service & Characteristic

* Create a GATT service in C
* Implement `write_cb` to collect incoming data into a buffer

### 4.3 Advertising

* Start BLE advertising with service UUID in AD payload
* Allow connections and data writes

## 5. Tracker Node Implementation

### 5.1 Configuration (prj.conf)

* Enable `CONFIG_BT_CENTRAL` and `CONFIG_BT_GATT_CLIENT`

### 5.2 Scanning & Discovery

* Start active BLE scan for all peripherals
* Filter advertisement data for the batch-service UUID

### 5.3 Connection & Discovery

* Establish connection upon finding a gateway
* Discover the write-characteristic handle

### 5.4 Data Upload

* Prepare batched payload in memory/flash
* Write the payload (possibly in chunks if >MTU)
* Handle completion callback and disconnect

## 6. On-Tracker Batch Management

* Data buffering strategy (RAM vs. flash circular buffer)
* Trigger conditions for upload (timer, buffer full)
* Marking successful uploads and garbage collecting old data

## 7. Retry & Fault Handling

* Scan timeout and backoff strategy
* Connection retry limits and error logging
* Partial-write recovery and batch reassembly

## 8. Testing & Validation

* Unit tests for scanning filter logic
* End-to-end integration: synthetic data on tracker, gateway reception
* Stress tests: gateways coming in/out of range

## 9. Deployment & Configuration

* Parameterizing UUIDs and scan intervals via Kconfig
* Power and performance tuning (BLE intervals, CPU sleep)

## 10. Future Enhancements

* MTU negotiation for larger payloads
* Security: pairing, encryption, signature verification
* Multi-gateway load balancing and batch acknowledgements
