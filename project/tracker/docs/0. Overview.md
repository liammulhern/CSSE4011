# Tracker Device: Functional Overview

The tracker cycles through a tight loop of **sleep → wake → sample/store → (optional upload) → sleep**, driven by timers and interrupts.

1. **Startup & Initialization**  
   - Bring up Zephyr kernel and Bluetooth stack  
   - Configure sensor drivers (I²C/SPI/ADC) and GPIO interrupts  
   - Initialize data buffer (RAM or flash-backed circular queue)

2. **Low-Power Sleep**  
   - Enter the MCU’s low-power state (e.g. `PM_STATE_IDLE`)  
   - Only the RTC timer and impact/GPIO interrupts remain active

3. **Wake-Up Sources**  
   - **Periodic Timer** (`k_timer` or RTC): wake every _N_ seconds to take routine measurements  
   - **Critical Interrupt** (e.g. impact sensor): immediate wake to timestamp and record event

4. **Data Sampling & Buffering**  
   - On wake, read all configured sensors (accelerometer, temperature, etc.)  
   - Timestamp each reading and push into the circular buffer  
   - Flag the buffer “batch-ready” when it reaches a threshold or on explicit trigger

5. **Batch Upload Coordination**  
   - If `batch_ready` is set, invoke the BLE bulk-upload sequence:  
     1. Scan for any gateway advertising the known service UUID  
     2. Connect, discover the write characteristic, and stream the buffered data  
     3. On success, clear the uploaded entries from the buffer  
   - Return immediately to low-power state once done

6. **Error Handling & Retries**  
   - If scanning or connection fails, back off (e.g. wait 30 s), then retry up to _M_ times  
   - Preserve old data on repeated failures; alert via status LED or log counter

7. **Power & Performance Optimizations**  
   - Disable unused peripherals before sleep  
   - Tune timer intervals and interrupt debouncing for minimal wake-up overhead  
   - Use flash persistence only for critical events or very large buffers
