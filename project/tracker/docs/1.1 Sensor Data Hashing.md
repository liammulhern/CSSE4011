# Tracker Data Integrity: Hashing & BLE Integration Overview

## 1. Goal

Ensure that batched sensor data collected by the tracker cannot be tampered with in transit or at rest. Each batch is hashed (or signed) on the tracker and verified by the gateway before processing.

## 2. Hashing Strategy

* **Algorithm**: Use SHA‑256 or HMAC‑SHA‑256 for collision resistance and authenticity.
* **Batch-Level**: Compute one hash over the entire batch payload rather than per-sample to minimize overhead.

  * Example: `H = HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, batch_bytes)`
* **Binary Framing**: Prepend a fixed-size header containing:

  1. **Magic number** (e.g. 0xBATCH)
  2. **Total payload length** (uint16\_t or uint32\_t)
  3. **Hash length** (uint8\_t)
  4. **Hash bytes** (32 bytes for SHA-256)

## 3. Key Management

* **Secret Storage**: Embed a per-device secret key in secure flash (e.g. Zephyr’s `CONFIG_SECURE_STORAGE`).
* **Key Rotation**: Allow over-the-air key updates via a secure provisioning channel.

## 4. Computing the Hash on Tracker

1. **Collect Samples** → Assemble `batch_bytes[]` (timestamps + sensor values).
2. **Compute HMAC**

   ```c
   #include <mbedtls/md.h>

   unsigned char hash[32];
   mbedtls_md_hmac(mbedtls_md_info_from_type(MBEDTLS_MD_SHA256),
                   secret_key, key_len,
                   batch_bytes, batch_len,
                   hash);
   ```
3. **Construct Framed Packet**

   * Allocate `frame_len = 2 + 4 + 1 + 32 + batch_len` bytes
   * Write header fields + `hash[]` + `batch_bytes[]`

## 5. BLE Characteristic & Writes

* **Characteristic Properties**: `WRITE_WITHOUT_RESP` for speed, or `WRITE` if confirmation required.
* **Chunking**: If `frame_len` > MTU, split into MTU-sized chunks.
* **Offset Write**: Use GATT’s `offset` parameter to reconstruct frame on gateway.
* **Flags**: Optionally use a header bit to mark “first-chunk” vs “final-chunk.”

### Tracker Write Sequence

```c
write_params.offset = 0;
write_params.data   = frame_bytes;
write_params.length = frame_len;
write_params.func   = on_write_complete;
bt_gatt_write(tracker_conn, &write_params);
```

## 6. Gateway Verification

1. **Reassemble Frame** via `write_cb` (using `offset`).
2. **Parse Header**: Extract `batch_len`, `hash[]`, and `batch_bytes[]`.
3. **Recompute HMAC** with the shared `secret_key`.
4. **Compare Hashes**:

   * If match → accept and process data.
   * If mismatch → discard and log security event.

```c
uint8_t computed_hash[32];
mbedtls_md_hmac(..., batch_bytes, batch_len, computed_hash);
if (memcmp(hash, computed_hash, 32) != 0) {
    LOG_ERR("Batch hash mismatch: potential tampering");
    return BT_GATT_ERR(BT_ATT_ERR_AUTH_FAIL);
}
```

## 7. Testing & Validation

* **Unit Tests**: Validate hash computation against known test vectors.
* **Integration Tests**: Send crafted frames with correct/incorrect hashes and verify gateway acceptance/rejection.
* **Fuzzing**: Randomize payloads and headers to ensure parser resilience.

## 8. Security Considerations

* **Replay Protection**: Include a monotonic batch counter or timestamp in the header and reject stale counter values.
* **Secure Key Provisioning**: Use JTAG locking or hardware security modules if available.
* **Encryption**: Optionally enable BLE encryption to protect confidentiality in transit.
