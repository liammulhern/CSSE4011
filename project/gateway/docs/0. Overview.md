# Gateway Device: High-Level Overview

## Purpose

* **BLE Peripheral**: Receive batched sensor data from tracker devices over BLE.
* **Cloud Bridge**: Transform and forward incoming data to Azure IoT Hub in the specified JSON format.

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities

* **Advertising & Connectivity**
  Act as a BLE peripheral advertising the “Batch Upload” service UUID to allow any tracker to connect and write data.
* **Data Reception**
  Accept and buffer characteristic writes from multiple trackers, handling chunked payloads and framing.
* **Data Transformation**
  Deserialize the raw batch, enrich with gateway metadata (e.g., gateway ID, timestamp), and reformat into the Azure IoT JSON schema.
* **Cloud Upload**
  Authenticate with Azure IoT Hub and send telemetry or device-to-cloud messages according to the Azure Device SDK or REST API.

## 2. BLE Peripheral Functionality

* **Service & Characteristic**

  * Primary service: `Batch Upload` (128-bit UUID)
  * Characteristic: Write-only, supports `WRITE` / `WRITE_WITHOUT_RESP`
* **Connection Lifecycle**

  * Advertise continuously
  * Accept connections, collect writes via `write_cb`
  * Disconnect after batch completion

## 3. Data Handling & Buffering

1. **Chunked Write Assembly**

   * Use offset and length in `write_cb` to assemble full batch buffer.
   * Detect final chunk via framing header or write-flag.
2. **Framing & Parsing**

   * Define a simple header (e.g., length + CRC) so the gateway knows when a complete batch is received.
   * Deserialize payload (binary or JSON) into internal data structures.

## 4. Azure IoT Hub Integration

* **Authentication**

  * Store device connection string or X.509 certificate securely on the gateway.
  * Use Azure IoT Device SDK for C (or REST) to establish TLS connection.
* **Message Formatting**

  * Wrap sensor readings in the required JSON schema:

    ```json
    {
      "deviceId": "<trackerId>",
      "gatewayId": "<gatewayId>",
      "timestamp": "<ISO8601>",
      "readings": [ ... ]
    }
    ```
* **Telemetry Upload**

  * Send as Device-to-Cloud messages, with `azure_iot_hub_client_send_event_async()` or equivalent.

## 5. Configuration & Deployment

* **Kconfig Options**

  * BLE settings (`CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL`, MTU, buffer sizes)
  * Azure IoT credentials (`CONFIG_AZ_IOT_CONNECTION_STRING`)
* **Build & Flash**

  * West or CMake build integrating both BLE and Azure SDK modules.

## 6. Error Handling & Retry Logic

* **BLE Errors**

  * Handle failed writes or connection drops by resetting buffer and re-advertising.
* **Cloud Upload Failures**

  * On transient errors (network/TLS), retry with exponential backoff.
  * On persistent auth failures, log and halt further uploads until credentials are refreshed.

## 7. Security Considerations

* **BLE Security**

  * Optionally require pairing/bonding and encryption (`CONFIG_BT_SMP`).
* **IoT Hub Security**

  * Use secure storage for keys/certificates.
  * Enforce TLS mutual authentication if using X.509.

## 8. Monitoring & Logging

* **Local Diagnostics**

  * Status LEDs or serial logs for BLE events and cloud upload status.
* **Cloud Telemetry**

  * Send gateway health metrics (uptime, memory, error counts) as separate messages.
