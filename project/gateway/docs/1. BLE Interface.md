# BLE Integration: High-Level Overview

This BLE integration lets tracker devices opportunistically upload batched 
sensor data to any nearby gateway that advertises the agreed-upon service UUID.  

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Gateway (Peripheral)**  
  - **Advertises** a fixed 128-bit “Batch Upload” service UUID  
  - **Exposes** a write-only characteristic for incoming data  
  - **Buffers** and processes each completed batch write  

- **Tracker (Central)**  
  - **Scans** for peripherals advertising the batch-upload UUID  
  - **Connects**, **discovers** the write characteristic, and **writes** its buffered data  
  - **Disconnects** once the batch is fully sent  

## 2. Advertising & Discovery

1. **Gateway**  
   - Starts BLE advertising with:  
     - Flags (general discovery, no-BR/EDR)  
     - 128-bit service UUID in AD payload  
2. **Tracker**  
   - Performs an **active scan** with duplicate filtering  
   - Parses each advertisement’s AD fields until it finds the target UUID  

## 3. Connection & GATT Interactions

1. **Tracker**  
   - Initiates a connection to the gateway once the UUID is spotted  
   - Uses GATT **discover** to locate the write characteristic handle  
   - Streams its batch—possibly in MTU-sized chunks  
2. **Gateway**  
   - `write_cb` collects each chunk at the given offset  
   - When the final chunk arrives (or based on a header flag), it hands off the full payload for processing  

## 4. Data Framing & Chunking

- **Framing Header** (optional)  
  - Include total payload length or a “last‐chunk” flag so the gateway knows when the batch is complete  
- **Chunked Writes**  
  - Break large batches into MTU-sized pieces  
  - Use `WRITE_WITHOUT_RESP` for speed, or `WRITE` if confirmation is required  

## 5. Lifecycle & Error Handling

1. **Tracker Loop**  
   - Sleep → wake (timer or interrupt) → sample/store →  
   - If batch-ready: BLE scan → connect → write → disconnect → back to sleep  
2. **Retries & Back-off**  
   - On scan or connection failure, wait (e.g. 30 s) before retrying  
   - Limit retry attempts to avoid draining battery  

## 6. Key Configuration Points

- **UUID Consistency**: hard-code the same 128-bit UUIDs in both firmwares  
- **MTU & Buffers**: tune `CONFIG_BT_GATT_TX_BUF_LEN` and `CONFIG_BT_GATT_ATT_MTU`  
- **Connection Limits**: configure `CONFIG_BT_GATT_CCC_COUNT` if supporting multiple simultaneous gateway connections
